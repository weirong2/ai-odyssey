**Example:**

**Movie Recommendations using Collaborative Filtering**

A streaming service wants to recommend movies to its users based on their viewing history and ratings. They have a vast collection of movies with associated metadata, such as genre, director, and release date.

**Data Used:**

- **User Data**: User ID, movie ID, rating (e.g., 1-5 stars)
- **Movie Metadata**: Movie ID, title, genre, director, release date

**AI Model:**

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize the data for uniformity.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the user ratings and movie metadata, such as:
	* User-based collaborative filtering (e.g., users with similar viewing history)
	* Item-based collaborative filtering (e.g., movies with similar genres or directors)
3. **Model Training**: Train a matrix factorization model (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)) to reduce the dimensionality of the user-movie interaction matrix.
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Use the trained model to generate movie recommendations for each user based on their viewing history and ratings.

**Recommendation Output:**

The AI model will output a list of recommended movies for each user, along with a predicted rating (e.g., 1-5 stars). The streaming service can now:

- **Personalize Recommendations**: Provide users with tailored movie recommendations based on their individual preferences.
- **Improve Engagement**: Increase user engagement by suggesting movies that are likely to be enjoyed.

**Benefits:**

- **Improved User Experience**: Personalized movie recommendations increase user satisfaction and retention.
- **Increased Revenue**: Relevant movie recommendations lead to increased viewing time and revenue for the streaming service.
- **Efficient Content Curation**: The AI model helps curate a vast library of movies, making it easier to discover new content.

**Real-world Impact:**

This example demonstrates how AI-powered recommendation systems can help businesses provide personalized experiences, increase user engagement, and drive revenue.
